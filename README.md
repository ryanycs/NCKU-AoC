# AI-ON-CHIP | 人工智慧晶片設計與應用

## Lab 1 - AI Model Design and Quantization

In the labs of this course, we will perform an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Lab 2 - Performance Modeling

In this lab, we will perform workload analysis based on the model architecture from Lab 1, develop an analytical model to predict system performance, and investigate the optimal software and hardware configuration.

## Lab 3 - Hardware Architecture Design

In this lab, we will design an accelerator based on the Eyeriss paper. The goal is to implement the hardware architecture required to efficiently compute the VGG-8 model designed in Lab 1.

## Lab 4 - Runtime and Performance Profiling

In this lab, we will implement a software driver to enable integration and operation of the previously designed hardware accelerator with the host system.

## Lab 5 - AI Compiler

In this lab, we will implement an AI compiler flow that bridges high-level machine learning models with low-level C code deployment, targeting CPU execution.
